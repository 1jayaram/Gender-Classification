# Gender-Classification

Gender Classification using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is a project that involves binary classification. The goal is to determine whether a given photo is of a male or female, assigning it a label of 0 or 1 using a neural network.

I have developed an interface allowing users to upload photos or access a webcam to obtain the gender classification output.
